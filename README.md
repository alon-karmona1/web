**Web Development project**<br>
In this project (part of Web Development course) I've built (with two other friends) a website for an organization called **"LemodAid"**. The construction of the site was divided into three main stages:

**Part A - site Characterization** <br>
organization Details(what is the organization, what is the business field, ways of activity and target audience), business processes in the company (will characterize 2 business processes and explain each process and how they will be implemented), definition of the company's website environment (theme, competitors' competition and comparison), Characterization Of the site (UI, UX, sketching of Header, Footer, navigation menu, etc.), creating ERD of the databases and tables which would be on the site.

**Part B - client side: HTML & CSS** <br>
Building the customer side of the site based on the characterization part. Building the infrastructure of the system, that is, building HTML pages that are designed and have behaviors that are linked to each other and contain mainly static content pages. Construction includes creating HTML pages, adding template pages (catalog page, product page), designing the site using CSS while adhering to CSS3 rules, and implementing forms on the site (login, sign up, donation)

**Part C - Server Side: JS, Flask & MySQL**  <br>
Characterization and construction of the server side based on the characterization part. Making the system infrastructure I built dynamic, based on data which was taken from the database. The construction includes creating and defining a related database, writing SQL queries (selecte, add, update, delete), implementing the dynamic content - implementing the template pages on the site, implementing the forms on the site, implementing a user page / profile page (by the "fetch" function and requesting/sending the data with the REST architecture according to the GET / POST / PUT / DELETE methods using JSON.
